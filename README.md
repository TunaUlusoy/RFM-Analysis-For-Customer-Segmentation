# RFM Analysis For Customer Segmentation

## Business Problem
FLO, an online shoe store, wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. To this end, the behaviors of the customers will be defined and groups will be formed according to the clusters in these behaviors.

## Dataset Definition
The dataset consists of the information obtained from the past shopping behaviors of customers who made their last purchases from FLO as OmniChannel (both online and offline shopper) in the years 2020-2021.

* **master_id**: Unique customer number
